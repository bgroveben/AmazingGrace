          <p>Grace Hopper was born Grace Brewster Murray on December 9, 1906 in New York city. Hopper attended Vassar College, graduating in 1928 with a degree in mathematics before receiving masters and doctorate degrees in mathematics and physics from Yale University in 1934.
          In 1943, at the age of 37, she enlisted in the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) and the following year was commissioned and assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant junior grade. There, she completed groundbreaking work in computer technology, including producing a model of the electronic computer, the Mark I, and introducing the word "bug" to describe a computer malfunction.

          In 1949, Hopper joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation, where she helped create the UNIVAC 1 computer, which was the first all-electronic digital computer. It was at Eckert-Mauchly that she began developing the compiler. Grace liked the idea of being able to use English to tell the machines what to do, and she helped out by developing a program called a linker (which was originally called a compiler, confusingly enough) during the 1940s and early 1950s. In 1954, Hopper was called upon to lead the department for automatic programming, where she helped design programming languages like FLOW-MATIC, which evolved into the Common Business Operating Language (COBOL).<small><sub>1</sub></small></p>
